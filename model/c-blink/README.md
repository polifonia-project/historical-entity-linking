# Constrained-BLINK (C-BLINK)

C-BLINK systematically filters out implausible entities during BLINK's candidate generation phase, where the dense representation of a sentence is compared to the dense representations of entity descriptions extracted from Wikipedia and encoded by a BERT-based model called the \textit{bi-encoder}. By enhancing the candidate generation phase, we integrate a plausibility check within BLINK's \textit{bi-encoder}.

In this folder, we publish only the scripts of the original BLINK that we have modified.
