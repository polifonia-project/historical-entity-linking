# Constrained-BLINK (C-BLINK)

C-BLINK systematically filters out implausible entities during BLINK's candidate generation phase, where the dense representation of a sentence is compared to the dense representations of entity descriptions extracted from Wikipedia and encoded by a BERT-based model called the bi-encoder. Enhancing the candidate generation phase allows us to integrate a plausibility check within BLINK's bi-encoder.

In this folder, we publish only the scripts of the original BLINK that we have modified.
